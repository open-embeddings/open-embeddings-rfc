# Plan for Open Embeddings Document Format

This directory will contain the draft RFC for the Open Embeddings specification. The plan is to:

1. Create a draft RFC in Markdown.
2. Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline to convert the Markdown to HTML and PDF.
3. Encourage community participation through pull requests and issues.
